# bioinspired-optimization
Bio inspired algorithms for multiparametric optimization.

This code was originally written as homework for the discipline "Sistemas Bioinspirados Aplicados à Engenharia" given by professor Daniel Muñoz Arboleda in the Mecatronics MSc program of the University of Brasilia, Brazil.

As of november/2015 this code is still being heavily modified. It provides basic tests and a minimal coherent framework to implement and benchmark optimization functions.

It still lacks external review and references to the original papers that proposed the algorithms and the fitness functions.

Language: Python
Requirements:
  Python 3+
  NumPy
  matplotlib
  scipy
